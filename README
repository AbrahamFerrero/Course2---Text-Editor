Then again, it's Abraham Ferrero, I'm going to show you where to find the actual coding I had to program is: 

- For the first week: src/document/BasicDocument.java (where the "TO DO" references are, as usual)

- For the second week: src/document/EfficientDocument.java, and for testing purposes, EfficientDocumentGrader.java

- Third week: src/textgen/MyLinkedList.java and for testing purposes, MyLinkedListTester.java, and for
the second part of the assignent: src/textgen/MarkovTextGeneratorLoL.java and MarkovTextGeneratorGrader.java for training purposes

- Forth week: Part1.-  src/spelling/DictionaryLL.java and DictionaryLLTester.java, a JUnit class for testing purposes.
Part 2.- src/spelling/AutoCompleteDictionaryTrie.java, and its tester to check everything was passed and right.

- Week 5 - Spelling sugestions.- src/spelling/NearbyWords.java
Word Paths (Optional but Recommended).- src/spelling/NWPTree.java and its tester file.

---------------------------------------------------------[ DESCRIPTION ]--

The files provided are skeleton code, as well as grading previews and 
testing files to be used in completing the course programming 
assignments. Additionally, you are provided a runnable JavaFX program 
which will help to test and demonstrate your implementations.

-------------------------------------------------------[ FILES BY WEEK ]--

Below are the files introduced in each week and used in each week
of the course. See file for description...

==============================================
document.Document.java
document.BasicDocument.java

Week 2 : Efficiency Analysis and Benchmarking
=============================================
document.EfficientDocument.java

Week 3 : Interfaces, Linked Lists vs. Arrays, and Correctness
=============================================================
textgen.MyLinkedList*.java
textgen.MarkovTextGenerator.java
textgen.MarkovTextGenerator*.java

Week 4 : Trees! (including Binary Search Trees and Tries)
=========================================================

---------------------------------------------------------------[ SETUP ]-- 

Importing Project into eclipse:
	1. Create a new Java Project in your workspace
	2. Import the starter files:
	  File -> Import -> Select "File System" -> Next -> Browse and set 
	  root directory to folder contents of zip were extracted to -> Finish

Feel free to use another IDE or manually compile and run your programs.
If you need help, google is your friend.
